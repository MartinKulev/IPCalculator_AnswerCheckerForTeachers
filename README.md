# About app
This app extracts all tests from the database, turned in from the [IP-Calculator-TestForStudents](https://github.com/MartinKulev/IP-Calculator-TestForStudents) and presents them to the teacher. This project was part of my thesis project for graduating high school, and it is now used in the educational process at my school.
